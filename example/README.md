This example is generated by the `yarn gen:example` command.

The source file is `hero.ts`, the generated ones are `hero.schema.ts` and `hero.integration.ts`

You can play by tweaking this `heros.ts` and running `yarn gen:example` to check the generated files.

Please note that this example is used as an integration test, since this `example` folder is part of the typescript project, this need to compiled without error!

You can also see that if `heros.ts` and `heros.schema.ts` are not in sync, `heros.integration.ts` will become red!
